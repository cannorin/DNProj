DNProj
======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cannorin/DNProj.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cannorin/DNProj)

Manage your .\*proj and .sln with commandline.

# dnproj

Use ``` dnproj ``` to edit your MSBuild/XBuild projects (.\*proj files).

For example:

``` dnproj new ConsoleApplication1 -t csharp ```

to create a new project with "Hello, World!" template, written in C#.

``` dnproj add SomeClass.cs ```

to add existing .cs file to your project.

``` dnproj add-ref System.Numerics ```

to add a reference to your project.

then...

``` xbuild ```

to build your project.

# dnsln

Use ``` dnsln ``` to edit your MSBuild/XBuild solutions (.sln files).

For example:


```dnsln new ConsoleApplication1 -t csharp```

to create a new solution with a new project with "Hello, World!" template.

```dnsln add-proj Library1.csproj```

to add an existing project to your solution.

```dnsln buildconf add Debug\|x64```

to add 'Debug|x64' configuration to your solution.

then...

``` xbuild ```

to build your solution.

# dnproj NuGet integration

You can easily install, update, remove, and restore NuGet packages.

``` dnproj nuget install NuGet.Core EntityFramework:5.0.0 ```

``` dnproj nuget update ```

``` dnproj nuget remove EntityFramework ```

``` dnproj nuget restore ```

If you want to restore NuGet packages in a solution, please use the original nuget command.

# build and install

DNProj itself requires Mono 3.x or later. 

Building DNProj requires ```make```, ```git``` and ```curl```.

Just type:

```bash
PREFIX=/path/to/your/destination make install
```
# zsh completion

## how to install

Copy ```misc/zsh-completion/*``` to your ```$FPATH```.

Make sure ```dnproj``` and ```dnsln``` are in your ```$PATH``` before use.

## autocomplete NuGet package names

When you use dnproj to install, update, restore, or search NuGet packages, dnproj will automatically store the names of the packages.

They will be stored to ```/tmp/*.cache```, where the ```*``` represents the escaped url of the NuGet repository you have used.

Those cached names will be used as suggestion when you do ```dnproj nuget install```, from the next time.
